NashvilleHousing Data clean

In this small project focused on housing data in SQL Server Management Studio, 
I have demonstrated several key data cleaning and manipulation techniques. 
Here are a few thoughts to highlight in my portfolio:

Data Standardization: I showcased my ability to standardize date formats using the CONVERT 
function. This highlights my attention to detail and the importance of consistent 
data representation.

Data Cleansing: By populating missing property addresses using the ISNULL and UPDATE statements,
I demonstrated my skills in handling missing data and ensuring data completeness.

Data Transformation: Breaking down the property address into individual columns
(address, city, state) using string functions like SUBSTRING showcases my ability to
transform data into a more structured format, making it easier for analysis and reporting.

Parsing and Splitting: Parsing the owner address and splitting it into separate columns 
(address, city, state) using PARSENAME and UPDATE statements highlights my proficiency 
in extracting relevant information from a given field.

Data Quality Enhancement: Changing 'Y' and 'N' values in the 'Sold as Vacant' 
field to 'Yes' and 'No' using a CASE statement demonstrates my commitment to improving 
data quality and making it more user-friendly.

Data Deduplication: Utilizing the ROW_NUMBER function and a common table expression (CTE), 
I effectively identified and removed duplicate records from the dataset. 
This showcases my ability to ensure data integrity and maintain a clean database.

Database Optimization: By removing unused columns using the ALTER TABLE statement,
I demonstrated my understanding of database optimization and the importance of 
efficient data storage.

Overall, this project highlights my expertise in data cleaning, transformation,
and database management using SQL Server Management Studio. 
It showcases my attention to detail, ability to handle missing data, and dedication to 
enhancing data quality. These skills make me a valuable asset in any data-related role, 
and I believe they should be highlighted in my portfolio to showcase my proficiency 
in data manipulation and database management.
